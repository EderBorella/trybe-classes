Describle exercises from day before in a logic manner:

1 - 
- Add the array.
- Create a for loop to navigate all the values in the array.
- Create a console.log for each loop, showing all the values from the array.

2 -
- Add the array.
- Create a variable to contain the sum of the array elements.
- Create a for loop to navigate each position in the array.
- For each loop for the above loop, add the value navigated in the variable sum.
- console.log the variable sum.

3 - 
- Add the array.
- Create a variable to contain the sum of the array elements.
- Create a for loop to navigate each position in the array.
- For each loop for the above loop, add the value navigated in the variable sum.
- console.log the variable sum divided by the number of elements in the array.

4 -
- Add the array.
- Create a variable to contain the sum of the array elements.
- Create a for loop to navigate each position in the array.
- For each loop for the above loop, add the value navigated in the variable sum.
- Create a if conditional, with the condition if sum plus than 20, displays "Value greater than 20.", else "value lower than 20."

5 - 
- Add the array.
- Create a variable to contain the first element of the array.
- Create a for loop to navigate the array.
- Create a if condition to check if the element in the loop is greater than the one in the variable.
- If positive, substitute the element in the variable.
- After the loop, print the variable created, that now shows the greatest element in the array.

6 -
- Add the array.
- Create a array to contain the odd numbers.
- Create a for loop to navigate the array.
- Create a if condition, if the number rest is different from 0, add the number to the odds array.
- Create a if condition, if the odds array have at least 1 element, print the odds array. Else, prints "No odd number in the array."

7 -
- Add the array.
- Create a variable to contain the first element of the array.
- Create a for loop to navigate the array.
- Create a if condition to check if the element in the loop is lower than the one in the variable.
- If positive, substitute the element in the variable.
- After the loop, print the variable created, that now shows the lowest element in the array.

8 -
- Create an empty array.
- Create a loop to start in 1 and stops in 25.
- For each loop, add the number in the created array.
- After the loop ends, print the array.

9 -
- Create an empty array.
- Create a loop to start in 1 and stops in 25.
- For each loop, add the number in the created array.
- After the loop ends, print the array divided by 2.
