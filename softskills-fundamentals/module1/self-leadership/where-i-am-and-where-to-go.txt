I've just start in the trybe course, for know I know a bit of HTML, JavaScript and CSS, but not enough to do something usefull. My main goal is to learn development, not just Web Development but something in the games area. TogethAside with the first goal, there another essential one, have a career and earn enough to have a good life, where I don't need to think twice before taking my wife to eat out.

How to get there:
- Continue focused in the Trybe course.
- Earn enough money to keep studing.
